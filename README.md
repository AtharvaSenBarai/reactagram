# Reflection

Tasked with creating a clone of a favourite website, this was created for the final project in The Odin Project's JavaScript section.
I went with Instagram as I figured I could showcase my skills by going deep with features. It's also very familiar and recognizable to most people.

For this project, I set out to build the most complete clone of Instagram on the internet. Shoot for the moon and land among the stars, right?
Although it's missing Instagram's chat and some small QoL features, I think I managed to do fairly well considering it was made solely by myself in 2.5 weeks rather than by the undoubtedly massive collective efforts of Facebook.

This project was challenging in terms of scope. I had to plan quite carefully in order to not create an impossible task for myself. Planning is incredibly valuable!
Fortunately, my previous projects had given me the tools I needed to create Reactaram. It was just a matter of putting in the hours and making it work.

This project made use of React, TypeScript, Firebase (partly through Reactfire), React Router, and styled-components. I also didn't want to waste time reinventing the wheel and used Bootstrap for just on UI element - a popover.

I chose React and TypeScript as they synergise incredibly well, with React allowing for blazingly fast website creation and TypeScript allowing for type-checking and reduced debugging time.
Firebase was an obvious choice as I have yet to learn backend and NodeJS (that's next!). Firebase is a backend-as-a-service that allows the data to be hosted for free by Google. Thanks Google!

The next time I create such an app, I hope to use a backend created by myself as well as learn more about animation in React.
